# Jini

**Private Document Intelligence** ÔÇö a local-first RAG workspace for personal documents.

Turn policies, statements, agreements, invoices, tax records, and other life-admin files into searchable answers, reminders, and structured insights.

[Live demo](https://jini-document-intelligence.vercel.app) ┬À [Developer documentation](https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/jini-document-intelligence/tree/main/docs) ┬À [Portfolio](https://mudityaraghav.vercel.app)

## Why this project matters

Jini demonstrates an end-to-end document intelligence workflow without requiring a hosted vector database or a paid model. It combines multi-format ingestion, ranked retrieval, citations, structured extraction, authentication, persistence, security controls, tests, and containerized delivery in one TypeScript codebase.

### Engineering highlights

- Local-first processing and SQLite persistence keep the default workflow private and self-contained.
- Retrieval works without an API key; Groq synthesis is an optional enhancement rather than a hard dependency.
- Upload validation, rate limiting, defensive headers, secure cookies, and origin controls are built into the API.
- Thirty unit tests cover extraction utilities, ranking, parsing, and answer generation.
- The responsive application and built-in documentation are deployed under a reverse-proxy subpath.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173/jini/`. The API runs at `http://localhost:8788`; Vite proxies `/api` to it.

### Test accounts
- **Test user**: `test@jini.local` / `JiniTest123!`
- **Guest**: click **Try live demo** for one-click access with sample data

## Features

- **Upload** PDF, DOCX, XLSX, CSV, TXT, Markdown, and JSON files
- **Extract** text, categories, tags, dates, amounts, and summaries automatically
- **Search** with ranked retrieval and document citations
- **Ask** questions with local extractive RAG (no API key required)
- **Synthesize** answers via Groq (optional, configure in Settings or `.env`)
- **Track** reminders from expiry, due, warranty, and renewal dates
- **Surface** high-value payments, subscriptions, tax coverage, and category mix
- **Works offline** ÔÇö documents and data stay on your machine

## Production Deployment

### Docker (recommended)

```bash
docker build -t jini .
docker run -d \
  -p 8788:8788 \
  -v jini-data:/app/data \
  -e GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_key_here \
  jini
```

Or with the included `docker-compose.yml`, which leaves Groq optional and persists the SQLite database and uploads in a named volume:

```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_key_here docker compose up --build
```

### EC2 (without Docker)

Requires Node.js 22+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BerlinDeskMudit/jini-document-intelligence.git
cd jini-document-intelligence
npm install
cp .env.example .env
nano .env              # add GROQ_API_KEY, adjust PORT if needed
npm run build
npm start
```

For a persistent process:

```bash
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start npm --name jini -- start
pm2 save
```

Open port `8788` in the EC2 security group, then visit `http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8788`.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `8788` | HTTP server port |
| `VITE_API_BASE` | same origin | Optional browser API origin; leave empty when using the Vite/nginx proxy |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | Set `development` for pretty logging |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Pino log level (debug, info, warn, error) |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | ÔÇö | Groq API key for LLM synthesis |
| `GROQ_MODEL` | `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` | Groq model name |
| `COOKIE_SECURE` | `false` | Set `true` behind HTTPS |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | `false` | Set `true` behind a reverse proxy |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | ÔÇö | Comma-separated CORS origins |

## Testing

```bash
npm test              # run once
npm run test:watch    # watch mode
```

30 unit tests covering text extraction, chunking, categorization, date/amount parsing, RAG scoring, and extractive answers.

## CI/CD

Push to `main` triggers GitHub Actions:
1. Lint ÔåÆ Test ÔåÆ Build
2. Docker image built and pushed to `ghcr.io/0xmudit/jini-document-intelligence:latest`
